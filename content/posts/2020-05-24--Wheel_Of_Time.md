[The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) is most definitely the best fantasy that I have read, not just in the past 10 years or so, but in my all reading life. I could always feel the pattern tugging me to keep reading, even after finishing the last book, The Memory of Light, just an hour ago!

Light, it's been so good that I am writing my first ever blog post just dedicated to it! The books depict a massive world and a complex yet simple magic system, with relationships between characters that you feel like you are re-living; and maybe you are, as we are just living in an age, there is no beginning nor end!

I can talk about the books for hours, but there are tons of podcasts and youtube channels that do a much better job than I can ever do, a few of my favorites are:

- [The Dusty Wheel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJR9kuOpT0TRh1deUl-zQqw) probably the oldest fan club out there, with weekly episodes, sometimes more than one episode a week.
- [Unraveling the Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtQ4ZscQ-2stjM1JdcBzLxA) hosting awesome fact based videos (well, fantasy fact, based on the books!), trying to explain the magic system, the comparison between these series and other famous series out there like Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones (which doesn't even come close to WoT IMHO)

But if I want to point out some of my take aways and lines of thought while I am still fresh, I would most probably say:

**Warning: Spoilers ahead**

- **Agility of This Age** I could easily differentiate between the style of writing of Robert Jordan and then the great work of Brandon Sanderson for the last books. If Robert Jordan wrote 5 pages to depict a scene, Brandon already wrote 1! I think it easily shows the difference between the modern agile era that we are living in and the world our parents experienced in their youth. Which style do I like most? I am more fan of RJ I'd say.
- **Our Mistakes Come Back to Us** It was quite a journey for Rand to become the dragon reborn, from a sheep herder to the lord of the morning. He made lots of mistakes as anyone would have done in his position and they always came back to him; some of his biggest mistakes were leaving Taim to himself, the man had come to him for recognition, but he was never really praised for his work in Black Tower; given that he didn't like to be a teacher in the first place. If he was given more responsibility after the initial Black Tower was established and was kept closer, maybe M'Hael was no more.
- **No Sexism is Tolerated** Yeah! The wheel has turned differently if our fellow ta'veren weren't so shied to treat both genders the same & punished/killed equally when they had to.

I am so happy that I listened to my friend Joshua a year ago and decided to give the first book of WoT a shot, I couldn't put it down afterwards, well, till I finished it tonight.

One word of advice: take the depression that comes after finishing the books seriously, it has never hit me so hard after finishing a series of books and frankly I don't know what I'm going to do. I might come here and update as what I did to overcome the depression that I felt after finishing the long series; for now I'm just [seeking advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/gpnxe5/how_to_deal_with_depression_after_finishing_the/?).

**Update**

Thanks to all heartfelt comments and suggestions in both my [twitter post](https://twitter.com/sirbijan/status/1264497887079051264) and [reddit WoT sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoT/comments/gpnxe5/how_to_deal_with_depression_after_finishing_the/?), I am feeling much better now and decided to read [New Spring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187065.New_Spring) for the time being and then continue with a re-read of the entire series! I might try the audio books, though I am more a reader than listener ðŸ¤“
