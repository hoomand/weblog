I am a system developer with Amazon Web Services as day job and a green dot collector on github over night, playing around with different libraries and new tech. I enjoy reading, mostly fantasy and sci-fi, though I've been pushing myself to read more reality books, however I haven't been too successful in that regard so far :D
